# generic_type_binary_search

C++ program that searches a value into a given vector <br>
It's called "generalized" due to the use of C++ templates throughout the code and because you can choose the data type of both the element to search and the vector,
thus generalizing the algorithm for different data types (int, long int, float, double and char)
